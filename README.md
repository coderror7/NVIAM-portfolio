🎨 Customization
Colors & Theme
The website uses a purple-pink gradient theme. To customize colors, edit the CSS variables in App.css:

/* Primary gradient colors */
background: linear-gradient(to right, #8b5cf6, #ec4899);

/* Update these hex values to change the theme */
Content
Update the content in each component file:

HeroSection.jsx - Your name, title, and main introduction
AboutSection.jsx - Your background and skills
ServiceSection.jsx - Services you offer
PortfolioSection.jsx - Your projects and work
ContactSection.jsx - Contact information and social links

Modify animation settings in the component files using Framer Motion props:

<motion.div
  initial={{ opacity: 0, y: 50 }}
  animate={{ opacity: 1, y: 0 }}
  transition={{ duration: 0.8 }}
>
